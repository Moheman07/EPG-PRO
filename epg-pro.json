    "description": "Liverpool have lost just one of their eight Premier League home games against Brighton, though it was the only other time they’ve faced them as the competition’s reigning champions. Mohamed Salah has been an unused substitute in two of Liverpool’s last three Premier League matches – he’d only been an unused sub in three of the first 303 matchday squads he featured in for the Reds. This season is Salah’s lowest tallies per 90 minutes for Liverpool for shots, shots on target and touches in the opposition box."

However, all five of his strikes this season have come in home games, while nine of his last 10 overall have come at St James’ Park.

Both of his goals have come from the penalty spot, with no Magpies player scoring a penalty in three consecutive Premier League games before."

    "description": "Liverpool have lost just one of their eight Premier League home games against Brighton, though it was the only other time they’ve faced them as the competition’s reigning champions. Mohamed Salah has been an unused substitute in two of Liverpool’s last three Premier League matches – he’d only been an unused sub in three of the first 303 matchday squads he featured in for the Reds. This season is Salah’s lowest tallies per 90 minutes for Liverpool for shots, shots on target and touches in the opposition box."
