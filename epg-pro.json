    "description": "Espanyol have not won any of their last 28 LaLiga games against Barcelona. Only two teams have gone 29 or more consecutive matches without a win against the same opponent in the competitions history: Real Sociedad against Real Madrid between 1957 and 1979 and Hercules also against Real Madrid between 1940 and 1984. FC Barcelona are unbeaten in their last 16 away LaLiga games against Espanyol, since a 3-1 defeat in January 2007 at the Lluís Companys. This run is only surpassed by Villarreal as their longest away unbeaten streak against the same opponent in the competitions history."
