Sudan are unbeaten in their last two games against Algeria in all competitions, winning on penalties in the quarter finals of the African Nations Championship in August and a 0-0 draw in the FIFA Arab Cup earlier this month. Algeria are making their 21st appearance at the CAF Africa Cup of Nations. They will be attempting to win the trophy for the third time, after 1990 and 2019 – both previous victories were won on North African soil: at home in 1990 and in Egypt in 2019."
