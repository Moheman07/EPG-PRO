    "title": "Arsenal vs. Manchester United - English Premier League 2026/2027",
    "description": "Arsenal have won each of their last four Premier League home games against Manchester United, the longest home winning run against them by any side in the competition. The last team to win five in a row in the league were West Brom between 1976 and 1980. Manchester United are winless in their last six Premier League games against Arsenal – they’ve never gone seven in a row without a win against the Gunners in their league history."
