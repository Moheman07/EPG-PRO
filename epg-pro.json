After their 1-0 win in May, Chelsea are looking for successive league victories over Manchester United for the first time since winning three in a row from November 2009 to March 2011 under Carlo Ancelotti. The Blues’ two wins in their last three league games versus the Red Devils are as many as their previous 17 beforehand."

    "description": "Ramadan is a crucial period in the Islamic calendar but fasting (Sawm) can provide complications for athletes who are trying to compete at the highest level. But to what extent is fasting a negative or can it actually aid performance? We look at the life and adaptation throughout Ramadan of Adam Azim – an unbeaten professional boxer from the UK, Fares El Bakh – a weightlifter who won Qatar’s first ever Olympic gold medal, and Zainab Alema – a rugby player who is aiming to become the first player to represent England wearing a hijab. Experts in Sports Science and Nutrition from Aspetar Clinic, Qatar also add detail of the physical impact athletes encounter during Ramadan."
