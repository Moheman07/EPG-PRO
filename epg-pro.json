Marseille are unbeaten in each of their last four away games against Belgian opposition in European competition, while keeping three clean sheets, since a 4-2 loss at Union Saint-Gilloise in the first round of the 1962-63 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup. Club Brugge, meanwhile, have already beaten French side Monaco 4-1 at home in this season’s UEFA Champions League league phase."

    "description": "This will be just the third season in which Atletico Madrid have faced a Norwegian side in major European competition, after 1991-92 v Fyllingen in the Cup Winners’ Cup and 2010-11 v Rosenborg in the UEFA Europa League. Including qualifiers, Atletico Madrid have won all six of their games against Norwegian teams by an aggregate score of 17-4. This will be the first time they have faced a Norwegian opponent during Diego Simeone’s 14-year tenure, however."
