They have not lost two consecutive league games against Real Betis since 1999. Real Madrid have won just two of their last eight home games against Real Betis, failing to score in six of those matches – they have failed to score in six home games against the Verdiblancos in LaLiga since the 2017/18 season, at least two more than against any other opponent."
