But to what extent is fasting a negative or can it actually aid performance? We look at the life and adaptation throughout Ramadan of Adam Azim – an unbeaten professional boxer from the UK, Fares El Bakh – a weightlifter who won Qatar’s first ever Olympic gold medal, and Zainab Alema – a rugby player who is aiming to become the first player to represent England wearing a hijab. Experts in Sports Science and Nutrition from Aspetar Clinic, Qatar also add detail of the physical impact athletes encounter during Ramadan."
