The Seagulls haven’t gone three without a goal since January 2024. Arsenal sit top of the Premier League for Christmas for the fifth time along with 2002-03, 2007-08, 2022-23 and 2023-24 – they have never won the competition from that position. Two of those have been under Mikel Arteta – no manager has ever been top at Christmas three times and never then won the competition."
